    "## Rules & Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **NO AI TOOLS**: You may **NOT** use ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, or any other AI assistant to generate code for this assignment. The goal is to build *your* fundamental skills. If you rely on AI now, the advanced topics later will be impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Study Groups Encouraged**: You **ARE** encouraged to discuss ideas, share approaches, and explain concepts to your study group peers. Teaching others is the best way to learn! However, the code you submit must be **your own work**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Your Resources**: You are free to use Google, StackOverflow, Pandas/Scikit-learn documentation, and your class notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comment Your Code**: Include comments explaining *why* you're doing what you're doing. I want to see your thought process.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Resubmission**: You may submit this assignment multiple times for feedback before each checkpoint deadline.\n",

    "## Important: Written Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, you'll see text cells asking you to explain your decisions, observations, and reasoning. **These written reflections are a critical part of your grade.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't just write one-word answers or skip these sections. Your reflections demonstrate:\n",
    "- Your understanding of the data science process\n",
    "- Your ability to communicate findings to stakeholders\n",
    "- Your critical thinking about data quality and feature importance\n",

The intangable things that could move the needle that are less numeric and more numbers based are things like the ambiance, service quality, chef experience and so on I suspect will play a smaller role but still a significant role."
